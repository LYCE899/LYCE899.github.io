Welcome to my personal website! My name is Amani Coulibaly, and I am a passionate full-stack developer specializing in creating innovative and impactful applications. I am currently pursuing a degree in Software Engineering at the African Leadership University. My journey into software development started with a fascination for how technology can solve real-world problems, and I have been dedicated to honing my skills ever since.

I am particularly interested in building web applications that improve the lives of people and streamline processes. My projects range from emergency response systems to budget management tools and community-driven platforms. I believe in continuous learning and strive to stay up to date with the latest technologies and development trends.

### What I Do:
- Full-stack development (React, Node.js, TypeScript)
- Web and mobile application development
- Building scalable and secure backend systems

I enjoy taking on challenging projects and solving problems with clean, maintainable code. Whether it's developing a feature, debugging an issue, or deploying an app, I aim to deliver high-quality solutions.

Feel free to explore my [Projects](#projects) section to see some of the work Iâ€™ve done. You can also connect with me through my [GitHub](https://github.com/LYCE899) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/Mariamcoulibaly/).
